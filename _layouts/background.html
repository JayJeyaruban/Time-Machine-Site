                    <p>The process for managing overtime could be made less ‘Administration’ intensive given the right
                        tool. Ideally any application used for overtime would be linked into ESS and either produces an
                        approved Special Claims form which can be submitted to HR or ties into payroll etc once approved
                        by a Team Leader etc. This would give a ‘one stop shop’ for engineers and managers so produce
                        and manage overtime requests through to submission.
