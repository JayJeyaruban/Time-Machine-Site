                        and when the deadline for doing this is. I am also responsible for trying to make sure that
                        we can maintain a good relationship with our client and we have all of the questions we
                        have, answered. I am hoping that fulfilling these roles will help to widen the range of
                        skills that I can offer to potential employers in the future, and will also help to produce
                        a good project for ATOS.</p>
