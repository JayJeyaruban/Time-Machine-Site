        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            After getting our project synopsis, we set about brainstorming some ideas on what we wanted to make and what
            our focus should be. Some ideas involved a full-stack application with a backend API with ideas being
            discussed on whether the focus should be the frontend design or the API so applications can be build upon it
            easily later by other teams. There were additional talks on mobile access and whether a mobile app should be
            made - or just focus on a mobile app altogether - or whether to make a web app thatâ€™s compatible with mobile
            devices. As a result, it became evident that the research into the various frameworks could be taken
            advantage of to assist our development process was necessary.

        </ul>

        <p>
            One of the options being considered was a mobile app. This was because the client was happy for us to focus on
            ideas and creating something unique and different from what they currently had. Whether alone or in tandem with
            a web app for computer access, we decided that the optimal thing to do would be to make apps for both iOS and
            Android since this would be the most convenient solution for the client as their staff make use of both
            platforms. This left us with a couple of options, either we make native apps for both Android and iOS using the
            native, first-class frameworks for both platforms (native apps), or we make use of a cross-platform framework
            that would allow us to build apps for both platforms simultaneously (hybrid apps).
        </p>
        <p>
            Native apps have several advantages over hybrid apps which all centre around usability. Native apps have better
            performance which can extend from the launch time of the app, its stability, to the smoothness of the animations
            and transitions within it, better, more reliable framework access to hardware functionality from the device -
            think GPS, camera, gyro etc. - and better support and documentation to rely upon. These are important aspects to
            consider as they play a vital role in improving the user experience. Despite these advantages, taking this
            approach would require knowledge of both Android and Swift/Objective-C and the platform frameworks necessary for
            development. On our team, only one member has experience with Android development which would require Swift and
            iOS to be learned from the beginning. This requirement is an important point to consider when decided what
            direction to take.
