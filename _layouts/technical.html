            After getting our project synopsis, we set about brainstorming some ideas on what we wanted to make and what
            our focus should be. Some ideas involved a full-stack application with a backend API with ideas being
            discussed on whether the focus should be the frontend design or the API so applications can be build upon it
            easily later by other teams. There were additional talks on mobile access and whether a mobile app should be
            made - or just focus on a mobile app altogether - or whether to make a web app thatâ€™s compatible with mobile
            devices. As a result, it became evident that the research into the various frameworks could be taken
            advantage of to assist our development process was necessary.
