    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
        In order to make sure that our project adheres to the requirements elicited from our client, we will be putting
        a great deal of focus on testing ensuring that it upheld throughout the development process. The following
        details on this page explore the testing strategies that we will be employing.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
    <p>
        Unit testing is a method of testing which can be utilised to test individual components of the system. We will
        be setting up these unit tests to operate automatically alongside our automatic deployment from github whenever
        there is a push to the main branch, ensuring that this push did not cause any damage to the web application. In
        order to conduct these unit tests automatically we plan to make use of several different unit testing
        frameworks. For the PHP + MYSQL backend we plan on utlising PHPUnit which is a popular PHP unit testing
        framework which produces HTML reports with code coverage. For our front-end we plan on using Unit.js which is a
        unit testing framework for javascript which works with any other testing framework and assertion library which
        will provide more flexibility for later in development.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Integration & Functional Testing</h4>
    <p>
        We will also using integration testing to make sure that all of the components within our system interconnect
        and function appropriately. Functional testing will be carried out in order to make sure that the system adheres
        to the functional requirements in order to produce a satisfactory web application for our clients. We have
        decided to accomplish this by using Selenium which is a commonly used open-source testing framework tailored
        towards testing web applications. This will allow us to send specific commands to the browser when our web
        application is open such that we can test the result and make sure its behaviour is as expected.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h4>User Acceptance Testing</h4>
    <p>
        Our main goal with this project is to ensure that we create a web application that our clients are clients are
        content with. In order to this we will maintaining consistent communication with our clients. We plan to
        incorporate user acceptance testing into our bi-weekly sprints as soon as we get the user interface to a stage
        where it will be easy for our clients to use. Weâ€™ll make to have test scenarios so we can focus down the
        features that they are testing and make sure they are aware of what we want them to accept.
