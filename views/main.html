                            and when the deadline for doing this is. I am also responsible for trying to make sure that
                            we can maintain a good relationship with our client and we have all of the questions we
                            have, answered. I am hoping that fulfilling these roles will help to widen the range of
                            skills that I can offer to potential employers in the future, and will also help to produce
                            a good project for ATOS.</p>

            <p class="card-content">The purpose of this project is re-design the current version of Time Machine which
                is software currently
                employed by ATOS. From their website ATOS is a company which is “focused on business technology that
                powers
                progress and helps organizations to create their firm of the future”, and Time Machine is the software
                that
                some departments of ATOS use to manage overtime payments however it was made quite some time ago, and is
                therefore missing some features which could improve its usability and its UI could also do with a
                redesign.
                At the end of the project, we aim to have a working prototype of an improved version of Time Machine
                which
                has a much more usable design and has additional features to ensure that there are a minimal amount of
                manual tasks. </p>
